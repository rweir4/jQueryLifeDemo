//if you click on a button, have a list of buttons pop up that you might like... do this for a couple times
//then have it suggest another character

//each button will do a hide and show and ajax... and then i need something that has event listeners turn on or off.
//maybe click a button to pin the associated button, and that turns off the ajax button
